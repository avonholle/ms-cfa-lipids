	doi = {10.1001/jama.2016.6458},
	abstract = {Abstract
{IMPORTANCE}:

Between 1980 and 2000, the prevalence of obesity increased significantly among adult men and women in the United States; further significant increases were observed through 2003-2004 for men but not women. Subsequent comparisons of data from 2003-2004 with data through 2011-2012 showed no significant increases for men or women.
{OBJECTIVE}:

To examine obesity prevalence for 2013-2014 and trends over the decade from 2005 through 2014 adjusting for sex, age, race/Hispanic origin, smoking status, and education.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}:

Analysis of data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES}), a cross-sectional, nationally representative health examination survey of the {US} civilian noninstitutionalized population that includes measured weight and height.
{EXPOSURES}:

Survey period.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}:

Prevalence of obesity (body mass index ≥30) and class 3 obesity (body mass index ≥40).
{RESULTS}:

This report is based on data from 2638 adult men (mean age, 46.8 years) and 2817 women (mean age, 48.4 years) from the most recent 2 years (2013-2014) of {NHANES} and data from 21,013 participants in previous {NHANES} surveys from 2005 through 2012. For the years 2013-2014, the overall age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 37.7\% (95\% {CI}, 35.8\%-39.7\%); among men, it was 35.0\% (95\% {CI}, 32.8\%-37.3\%); and among women, it was 40.4\% (95\% {CI}, 37.6\%-43.3\%). The corresponding prevalence of class 3 obesity overall was 7.7\% (95\% {CI}, 6.2\%-9.3\%); among men, it was 5.5\% (95\% {CI}, 4.0\%-7.2\%); and among women, it was 9.9\% (95\% {CI}, 7.5\%-12.3\%). Analyses of changes over the decade from 2005 through 2014, adjusted for age, race/Hispanic origin, smoking status, and education, showed significant increasing linear trends among women for overall obesity (P = .004) and for class 3 obesity (P = .01) but not among men (P = .30 for overall obesity; P = .14 for class 3 obesity).
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}:

In this nationally representative survey of adults in the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in 2013-2014 was 35.0\% among men and 40.4\% among women. The corresponding values for class 3 obesity were 5.5\% for men and 9.9\% for women. For women, the prevalence of overall obesity and of class 3 obesity showed significant linear trends for increase between 2005 and 2014; there were no significant trends for men. Other studies are needed to determine the reasons for these trends.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Familism and parental respect are culturally derived constructs rooted in Hispanic and Asian cultures, respectively. Measures of these constructs have been utilized in research and found to predict delays in substance use initiation and reduced levels of use. However, given that these measures are explicitly designed to tap constructs that are considered important by different racial/ethnic groups, there is a risk that the measurement properties may not be equivalent across groups.
{METHODS}: This study evaluated the measurement equivalence of measures of familism and parental respect in a large and diverse sample of middle school students in Southern California (n = 5646) using a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis approach.
{RESULTS}: Results showed little evidence of measurement variance across four racial/ethnic groups (African American, Hispanic, Asian, and non-Hispanic White), supporting the continued use of these measures in diverse populations. Some differences between latent variable means were identified - specifically that the Hispanic group and the white group differed on familism.
{CONCLUSIONS}: No evidence of invariance was found. However, the item distributions were highly positively skewed, indicating a tendency for youth to endorse the most positive response, which may reduce the reliability of the measures and suggests that refinement is possible.},

	abstract = {Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors. For example, it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved (underlying) variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables. The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus "error" terms. The information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Factor analysis originated in psychometrics and is used in behavioral sciences, social sciences, marketing, product management, operations research, and other fields that deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying/latent variables.
Factor analysis is related to principal component analysis ({PCA}), but the two are not identical. There has been significant controversy in the field over differences between the two techniques (see section on exploratory factor analysis versus principal components analysis below). Clearly though, {PCA} is a more basic version of exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) that was developed in the early days prior to the advent of high-speed computers. From the point of view of exploratory analysis, the eigenvalues of {PCA} are inflated component loadings, i.e., contaminated with error variance.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Colorectal cancer patients with liver-confined metastases are classified as stage {IV}, but their prognoses can differ from metastases at other sites. In this study, we suggest a novel method for risk stratification using clinically effective factors.

Materials and Methods
Data on 566 consecutive patients with colorectal liver metastasis ({CLM}) between 1989 and 2010 were analyzed. This analysis was based on principal component analysis ({PCA}).

Results
The survival rate was affected by carcinoembryonic antigen ({CEA}) level (p {\textless} 0.001; risk ratio, 1.90), distribution of liver metastasis (p=0.014; risk ratio, 1.46), and disease-free interval ({DFI}; p {\textless} 0.001; risk ratio, 1.98). When patients were divided into three groups according to {PCA} score using significantly affected factors, they showed significantly different survival patterns (p {\textless} 0.001).

Conclusion
The {PCA} scoring system based on {CEA} level, distribution of liver metastasis, and {DFI} may be useful for preoperatively determining prognoses in order to assist in clinical decisionmaking and designing future clinical trials for {CLM} treatment.},

Using carefully laid out examples and engaging applications, the book begins with an introductory chapter that serves as a general overview of multiway analysis, including the types of problems it can address. Next, the process of setting up, carrying out, and evaluating multiway analyses is discussed along with commonly-encountered issues, such as preprocessing, missing data, model and dimensionality selection, postprocessing, transformation, as well as robustness and stability issues"--Provided by publisher.},
